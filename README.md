Running the .R file in this repo reads the survey data file received from Trinity, and the compilation of geologic log data created by Trihydro, and writes the information contained in those files to Leapfrog Hydro input files, collar.csv and lithology.csv

The file Lithology_hi_res.csv is also generated by the code.  This file contains only the borings within a small sub-area of the site where geophysical borings were conducted.  The file was used in a sequence stratigraphy analysis.  The sequence stratigrahpy analysis produced files are not in this repo.   They reside here:
- M:\ItoN\MidnightSunTrinityJV\Modeling


The following are file paths for input data to the R code:

"M:\ItoN\MidnightSunTrinityJV\Modeling\Survey Data.xlsx"

"M:\ItoN\MidnightSunTrinityJV\Modeling\Copy of LeapfrogInput-MK (3) _ TM edit.xlsx"
